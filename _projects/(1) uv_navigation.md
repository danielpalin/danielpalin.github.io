description: >
  A bio-inspired autonomous navigation system that uses UV reading magnitude, similar to moths, to estimate heading and guide a mobile robot. This control system was tested on a real robot using proportional control, and it reduced mean horizontal path deviation by 48% compared to an open loop baseline.
