description: >
  A comparative analysis between a traditional sampling based path planner, BIT*, and the generative model Motion Planning Diffusion, on a 7 DoF arm. Implemented simulations in Isaac Sim. It was found that BIT* generated smoother trajectories, which was surprising, and it generated shorter average path lengths, than MPD after 3 seconds. The path planning algorithms performed well on complementary tasks.
