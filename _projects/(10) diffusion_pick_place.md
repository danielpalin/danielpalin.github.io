description: >
  A diffusion-based robotic manipulation system that uses a U-Net policy to generate smooth 6-DoF pick-and-place actions. Built on Google’s Ravens framework, the model learns from expert demonstrations to perform precise grasping and placement through iterative denoising and trajectory sampling.
