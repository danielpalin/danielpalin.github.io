# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a student about to go into my masters who has a passion for autonomous robotics. I've been self studying reinforcement learning and working on physical ROS 2 based robotics projects, with the hope of one day contributing to autonomous humanoid robots deployed in homes.
